== Frequently asked questions ==

= Instagram Images Not Showing or Broken =

There will be occasions when the API has been changed by Instagram, and the Access token that was previously created no longer works.

In this case the feed may disappear. To get your images working again it is necessary to regenerate the access token. Simply go to Flo Social > Then click “Get Access Toke” and create a new USER ID and ACCESS TOKEN, then “save changes”. You feed should now be showing.

= Broken Image Links =

Another issue may be that the images are showing a broken image icon. If that's the case there are 3 things that may resolve this issue.

<ol>
  <li>Update your plugin to the most recent version, go to plugins and check if there is an update available.</li>
  <li>Clear your browser cache, and any caching on your site (via plugins etc).</li>
  <li>For widgets and feeds, Change the image size for your images, this will regenerate the thumbnails for the images.</li>
</ol>
