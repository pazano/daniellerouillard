Supported css classes:

layout_sidebars -> sets the proper width for the layout icons

hidden-label -> use this class if you need to hide the label for the Image select field


The custom image select fields have problems with the Conditional Logic.
Therefore if you need to use conditional logic, use 'radio inputs' and use the class 'flo-image-select'

That class is used by the js and the icon is inserted afer the radio button.

 the icon should be in png format and have the same name as 
 the radio input value.
 i.e. if the radio input has the value 'full_width' ,  then the icon should be full_width.png
