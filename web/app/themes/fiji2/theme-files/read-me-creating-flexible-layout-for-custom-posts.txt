- Install and activate Flo Pack (Flo Backery) plugin to avoid conflicts with the custom fields json files

- Make sure the theme has support for the Flexible content and new custom post types. 
	The example can be checked for Cannes and FIji 2 in: 
	/cannes/theme-files/views/layout/page.blade.php
	/cannes/theme-files/flo_layout_templates/global-post.template.php
	/cannes/theme-files/app/acf-options-page.php


- Create your Post type.


- Create a new Field group for the new post type options page (clone the Gallery options for example) and choose
	to show that on the Options page created above: https://i.imgur.com/Eh2jWBU.jpg
	Make sure to replace the clonned names with something appropriate for this custom post type: https://i.imgur.com/o9NBQBF.jpg
	The names used here will be used further in the other steps.

- Create a Field group for the new post type.  Example from Cannes:

- Create in the child theme the following folder:
	/theme-files/flo_layout_templates/

- Inside 'flo_layout_templates' create a file  %post_type%-default.template.php

- Use the 'flo_subpages_options' filter in the child thme to add a new menu in the  Options page:

- Use the 'flo_custom_post_type_layout' filter in the child theme
		https://pastebin.com/dW3jER18

- Remove filter 'flo_cached_layout_options' for the current theme, and register a new one on the child theme that includes
	the layouts for the new custom posts.

- In the theme-filters.php file find the 'flo_layout_options_name' filter.
	Remove it, and add it one more time from the child theme with the complete option array


- For the new post type it is necessary to create the blade view in the child theme. To do that we will have to create the following: ...-child/theme-files/views/%custom_post_type%/single.blade.php		(replace %custom_post_type% with the correct value), and add in it the code from the parent theme for the single blog post for example: cannes/theme-files/views/post/single.blade.php

- Add the following filter: 'flo_any_custom_post_option'
  Ex: https://pastebin.com/0dJBcqKv

- Add the following filter: 'flo_'.$any_custom_post_option[$url_args['query']].'_fields_key'
  Ex: https://pastebin.com/CS3zhkDU

- Add the following filter: 'flo_other_custom_post_types_options'
  Ex: https://pastebin.com/iuZhrDC4

- Add the following filter: 'flo_custom_posts_scree_post_types'
  Ex: https://pastebin.com/1J0RqHRf

- Add the following filter: flo_single_%screen_post_type%_fields_key
  Ex: https://pastebin.com/TMVSzu0M

- Edit 'Flag. Post Options' and add the new custom post type and page options:
