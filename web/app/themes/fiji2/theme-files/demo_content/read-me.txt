Intructions about setting up the export files.



You must have installed the following plugins:

widget-importer-exporter - https://github.com/stevengliebe/widget-importer-exporter

flo-exporter


Then you will have an option to access Export settings in WP options.
This will generate a zip file that will contain the following files:

export.xml
nav_menus.options
static_pages.options
widgets.options


Then you'll have to go in the theme options and coppy the code from Export zone and create a file called 'fw_import.options' and paste those option in there.

And in the end you must put  the following files inside export folder:

export.xml
nav_menus.options
static_pages.options
widgets.options
fw_import.options
